# Customer-Segmentation
## Project Overview
The Customer Segmentation project is aimed at helping businesses better understand and categorize their customer base. By analyzing various attributes and behaviors of customers, we aim to identify distinct segments that share similar characteristics. This segmentation can be used to tailor marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Dependencies
In this project, we aim to perform Customer Segmentation using Python.

The entire project was developed on the Anaconda environment.

To run the code, you'll need to install the following dependencies with the given version or above:
* Anaconda 23.7.4
* Python 3.9 
* Pandas 1.5.3
* Sci-kit Learn 1.3.0
* Matplotlib 3.7.1
* Seaborn 0.12.2

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

 !pip install pandas==1.5.3 scikit-learn==1.3.0 matplotlib==3.7.1 seaborn==0.12.2 

## Data Source
Dataset Link: [MallCustomers.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/mall-customers)

The features of the dataset are 
* CustomerID - Unique ID assigned to the customer
* Gender - Gender of the customer
* Age - Age of the customer
* Annual Income (k$) - Annual Income of the customer
* Spending Score (1-100) - Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature
  
## Execution
The code can be executed in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.

* Make sure to have the "MallCustomers.csv" file in the same directory as the code file.
* After installing all dependencies, run the CustomerSegmentation.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
